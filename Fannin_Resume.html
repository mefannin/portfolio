                <h1>Work Experience</h1>
                <p>During my time in my engineering class at school, I have been 
                given the opportunity to go on many educational field trips. One 
                trip that stood out to me was when I went to visit the Patriot Jet 
                Team Foundation.  The foundation had many fighter jets and simulators 
                that we were allowed to use. The presentation was led by experienced 
                pilots who taught us not only about their time in the sky, but about
                how engineering disciplines apply to the manufacturing and maneuvering 
                of their airplanes. They went into depth about how lift and drag
                work on jets and how both the materials and shape of the planes 
                had to be created to insure the smoothest flight. At the end of 
                the field trip, the director also showed us a presentation talking 
                about all the projects created by engineers in the field of aerospace
                engineering, such as the SpaceX project by Elon Musk. These real-world 
                examples and applications made me realize how important engineering 
                is in everyday life and only boosted my interest in the field. Although 
                I am not particularly interested in the field of aerospace engineering, 
                the lessons we learned at the foundation helped reinforce topics 
                we just learned in class about air movement and free body diagrams.
                Overall, this field trip was very eye-opening and helpful. Another 
                trip that furthered my interest in engineering was a trip to Stanford 
                and the Computer Science History Museum. This was my first time on 
                the Stanford campus and I fell in love with the layout and research 
                centers they offered. It inspired me to shoot for higher education 
                so that in the future I could end up at a prestigious institution. 
                The  Museum was also extremely interesting. I was able to see how 
                computers and intelligent machines have progressed over time. I am 
                so thankful that I was able to have the experience to go on these 
                educational trips. </p>
                <p>One of the other amazing opportunities I receive during class 
                is the ability to listen to multiple guest speakers that have shared 
                their job experience in different fields of engineering. My favorite 
                speakers were Dan Cherrier and Natalina Bernardi, who were professional
                civil engineers. They gave me crucial information about how to select 
                the correct university based on my future career, what to expect 
                when working, and how to get a license to practice. I myself am 
                interested in civil engineering, so this presentation was very helpful. 
                Both of them emphasized how difficult obtaining an engineering degree 
                can be and how important it is to be licensed. This only pushed me
                to want to try harder in school to reach their level of expertise. 
                They also explained certain aspects of their job, and how they helped 
                build parts of the Bay Bridge and numerous roads. I love the idea 
                of creating new infrastructure for my community and being a part 
                of rewarding projects. Another speaker I found interesting was 
                Maynard Holliday. He worked for the United States Department of 
                Defense, specifically in the field of machine building. He talked 
                to us about how he has been creating new technology that will improve 
                nuclear power plants and change the course of warfare. He showed 
                us examples of how new technology is aiding soldiers so they can 
                carry more supplies and risk less lives because they have automated
                systems for spying. He really opened my eyes to the ways technology 
                can be used in all aspects of the world and furthered my interest 
                in engineering.</p>
                <p>Through the engineering academy, I have also been introduced to 
                a mentor who is currently in the work-force. I am currently working
                with Kaley Oldani who is an Environmental Engineer at Lawrence Livermore
                Labs. She has told me all about the work she has done and how it 
                has impacted her life in many positive ways. She has also been giving 
                me such great advice on how to handle stress in high school and how
                to improve my leadership skills. So far the most important thing  
                I have learned from my mentor is that effort and perserverence are 
                more important than skill. As long as I continue to have a positive 
                attitude and exert my full effort. I can complete any task.</p>
