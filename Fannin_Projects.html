            <h2>Water Filtration Project:</h2>
            <h3>6/2/18-6/17/18, Ningxia, China</h3>
            
            <p>This summer I traveled to a remote village in Ningxia, China with 
            other students in California to work on a water filtration project. 
            The objective of the project was to bring and test sustainable filtration
            systems that the people in the village could use. When we first got to 
            the village, we conducted a series of interviews, from which we learned that 
            a majority of the villagers obtained their water from the rain or
            the Yellow River. Both of these water sources proved quite hazardous 
            when my group tested the sources for hazardous chemicals. During the 
            trip, I was chosen as the co-leader of my group and it was my job to 
            delegate tasks and come up with daily goals for my group. My group was able
            to successfully get rid of many of the contaminants in the villagers' water 
            and distribute some of the Mesopaper filters that we brought. We chose Mesopaper 
            because it was very durable, sustainble, biodegradable, and effective. After
            this trip, my club back in California hopes to maintain contact with the
            villagers and set up a system to transport them more villagers.</p>

            <h2>Base Isolation Project:</h2>
            <h3>7/16/18-8/13/18, UCSD COSMOS</h3>
            
            <p>This summer, I had the opportunity to work with other students around
            California on project regarding certain aspects of Civil Engineering. 
            I worked on this project for around one month on the UCSD campus, and I 
            received assistance from both college professors and currently enrolled 
            students from UCSD. Each group in my camp cluster was assigned the task 
            of building an earthquake resistant system and researching a certain 
            seismic region. My group in particular researched base isolation systems
            which reduce the acceleration and movement of buildings during earthquakes. 
            We also researched the seismic characteristics of the Peru-Chile Trench,
            and how these base isolation mechanisms could be implemented in the region.
            Additionally during the camp, each student had the option to write an 
            essay explaining how engineering ethics was important to their desired 
            field. I wanted to understand more about how important it was for engineers
            to be conscious of their design decisions in order to make the safest 
            structures possible.</p>

            <h2>Machine Control Design Project:</h2> <!--makes heading for the project-->
            <h3>4/20/18-5/3/18, Principles of Engineering</h3>
                
            <p>The objective of this project was to create a prototype with  <!--paragraph with project content-->
            a companion code that would complete a certain task given to us 
            by our teacher. With the options provided, my group chose to make 
            a cookie machine. This machine was supposed to move cookies to a 
            separate area and once three cookies had been transferred, the 
            machine would again move those three cookies to an additional area 
            that served as a packaging area. The machine was to be made out 
            of multiple VEX parts and was to be programmed using the RobotC 
            software. My main role in this project was the building of the 
            actual prototype. My group had a lot of issues with collaborating 
            because multiple group members were gone for up to a week. I really 
            had to make sure that we were keeping a strict building schedule 
            so we could finish the prototype quickly and then program the actual 
            movements of the device. I also had a large role in choosing the 
            parts to build the prototype. When we first began building, our 
            group only had a rough sketch of what we wanted it to look like 
            and we also ran into many issues. At times our "cookie" would not 
            slide smoothly down the incline plane we created or the light sensors 
            would not sense the "cookie" correctly. This required me to be flexible 
            so that I could deal with the problems quickly and move onto the 
            next step. I also did a lot of work on the documentation, specifically 
            creating the decision matrix and describing the final design. A 
            lot of specific explanations were required to complete these sections 
            properly so I had to spend a lot of time making sure that our design
            process was clear. From this project I learned how to be flexible 
            and I learned more about the programming process. I had to learn 
            that your code will not always work perfectly the first time, and 
            that you just have to keep persisting to make it right. I also had
            to be flexible and deal with our problems head in instead of becoming 
            upset, which is a very useful skill in life and the workforce. </p>

            <h2>Solar Hydrogen Vehicle Project:</h2>
            <h3>11/2/17-11/16/17, Principles of Engineering</h3>
    
            <p>The main objective of this project was to design a prototype     
                    that used solar and hydrogen cells as its fuel source and create 
                    the fastest and most efficient system possible. Multiple configurations 
                    of each type of cell had to be configured using a breadboard and 
                    the values of current and voltage were used to calculate overall 
                    power and efficiency. In addition to building the prototype, documentation 
                    of the design process and outcome were necessary. My main role in 
                    this project was helping design the prototype that would hold the 
                    fuel cells, calculating power and efficiency of each configuration, 
                    and labelling the pictures in the documentation.  We had constraints 
                    regarding vehicle size, so I had to find a small vehicle where large 
                    fuel cells could fit. I designed the chain and sprocket system that 
                    connected to the motor turned by the fuel cells and the wheels of 
                    the prototype. I also figured out how to attach the hydrogen and 
                    solar cells to the top of the vehicle. Regarding measurements, I 
                    measured the voltage and current with a multimeter based on how my 
                    team wired the breadboard and I calculated power with basic formulas
                    which were added to the documentation. Through the design process,
                    my team ran into some issues such as the vehicle becoming too heavy. 
                    I had to lead my team to decide which components of our original 
                    design were not necessary. From this issue I learned to collaborate 
                    and lead a team. From this project, I also learned the skills of 
                    efficiency calculation and scaling models. Both of these skills 
                    would be very useful in my desired career of environmental engineering 
                    that require the ability to figure how efficient a model is, and 
                    how to scale it to a real and usable device.</p>
