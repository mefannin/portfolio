                    <p>The objective of this project was to create a prototype with   <!--paragraph describing the project-->
                    a companion code that would complete a certain task given to us 
                    by our teacher. With the options provided, my group chose to make 
                    a cookie machine. This machine was supposed to move cookies to a 
                    separate area and once three cookies had been transferred, the 
                    machine would again move those three cookies to an additional area 
                    that served as a packaging area. The machine was to be made out 
                    of multiple VEX parts and was to be programmed using the RobotC 
                    software. My main role in this project was the building of the 
                    actual prototype. My group had a lot of issues with collaborating 
                    because multiple group members were gone for up to a week. I really 
                    had to make sure that we were keeping a strict building schedule 
                    so we could finish the prototype quickly and then program the actual 
                    movements of the device. I also had a large role in choosing the 
                    parts to build the prototype. When we first began building, our 
                    group only had a rough sketch of what we wanted it to look like 
                    and we also ran into many issues. At times our "cookie" would not 
                    slide smoothly down the incline plane we created or the light sensors 
                    would not sense the "cookie" correctly. This required me to be flexible 
                    so that I could deal with the problems quickly and move onto the 
                    next step. I also did a lot of work on the documentation, specifically 
                    creating the decision matrix and describing the final design. A 
                    lot of specific explanations were required to complete these sections 
                    properly so I had to spend a lot of time making sure that our design
                    process was clear. From this project I learned how to be flexible 
                    and I learned more about the programming process. I had to learn 
                    that your code will not always work perfectly the first time, and 
                    that you just have to keep persisting to make it right. I also had
                    to be flexible and deal with our problems head in instead of becoming 
                    upset, which is a very useful skill in life and the workforce. </p>

                    <p>The main objective of this project was to design a prototype     <!--paragraph describing the project-->
                    that used solar and hydrogen cells as its fuel source and create 
                    the fastest and most efficient system possible. Multiple configurations 
                    of each type of cell had to be configured using a breadboard and 
                    the values of current and voltage were used to calculate overall 
                    power and efficiency. In addition to building the prototype, documentation 
                    of the design process and outcome were necessary. My main role in 
                    this project was helping design the prototype that would hold the 
                    fuel cells, calculating power and efficiency of each configuration, 
                    and labelling the pictures in the documentation.  We had constraints 
                    regarding vehicle size, so I had to a small vehicle where large 
                    fuel cells could fit. I designed the chain and sprocket system that 
                    connected to the motor turned by the fuel cells and the wheels of 
                    the prototype. I also figured out how to attach the hydrogen and 
                    solar cells to the top of the vehicle. Regarding measurements, I 
                    measure the voltage and current with a multimeter based on how my 
                    team wired the breadboard and I calculated power with basic formulas
                    which were added to the documentation. Through the design process,
                    my team ran into some issues such as the vehicle becoming too heavy. 
                    I had to lead my team to decide which components of our original 
                    design were not necessary. From this issue I learned to compensate 
                    and lead a team. From this project I also learned the skills of 
                    efficiency calculation and scaling models. Both of these skills 
                    would be very useful in my desired career of environmental engineering 
                    that require the ability to figure how efficient a model is, and 
                    how to scale it to a real and usable device.</p>
