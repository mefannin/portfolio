                <p>Hello! My name is Megan Fannin and I am     <!--first paragraph-->
                currently a junior in high school. As long as I can remember, 
                I have always been fascinated with the idea of structures.
                Everytime I walk inside one, I notice its architectural
                features, the reinforcements, and its minuet details. 
                Through my observations, I have discovered my love for
                engineering, which has driven me to take multiple engineering 
                courses offered at my school. I hope that the skills I have 
                learned from these classes can lead me to a graduate program 
                in Civil Engineering and eventually a hands-on job in that 
                field.</p>
                <p>Balancing work, ice skating, piano, debate,            <!--second paragraph-->
                and school takes a lot of discipline and responsibility. 
                Through each of these activities I have participated in, 
                I have evolved character traits that will assist 
                me when I move into the work force. My main work experience
                has been being employed as a camp counselor and babysitter. 
                With both babysitting and counseling, I constantly have to balance being a playmate
                and rule enforcer. If a child does not listen I have to 
                enforce rules in a new way for them to understand. This has 
                shaped me to become resourceful, pushing me to think quickly 
                and creatively to present an idea or activity in a more 
                engaging way. I am additionally the Treasurer of the Speech 
                and Debate club. This position has taught me to be cooperative, 
                responsible, and thorough. In debate, you must prepare for 
                the topic you will be presenting at least one month in advance. 
                There is a lot of work and time that goes into preparing 
                because you must have deep insight into the topic and be 
                able to supply numerous sources to defend your point. 
                During this process, I also have a debate partner who I must 
                cooperate with in order to be successful. Lastly, I must be 
                thorough in order to prove my point and win the debate. 
                All the traits of resourcefulness, cooperativeness, responsibility, 
                and thoroughness are valuable in civil engineering. 
                It is important to cooperate with others because  I will 
                be working in a team of engineers. Also to create new and 
               efficient technology, I need to be resourceful because there 
               will always be constraints I will have to work around.</p>
               <p>Through all the extracurriculars I have                   <!--third paragraph-->
               completed, there are some accomplishments that I am very proud of. 
               I am a part of a synchronized ice skating team, and we have 
               traveled to many nation-wide competitions. In particular, 
               my team has won first place awards on a national level at
               the ISI World Championship for the past 4 years. Another 
               accomplishment of mine is participating in the COSMOS summer 
               program at UCSD. This is a 4 week summer camp where only 
               150-200 students are accepted, and I got the opportunity 
               to work with college professors and research analysts in  
               the field of Structural and Geotechnical Engineering. I 
               was able to learn so much about the challenges that Structural 
               Engineers  encounter in their everyday lives. I was also 
               able to create my own research project, in which I studied 
               and built base isolation systems. Additionally, this past 
               summer I traveled to Ningxia, China  for 2 weeks to volunteer 
               in a local village. A group of 5 students and brought and 
               tested  different water filtration systems that we could 
               distribute to the villagers. These villagers were in desperate 
               need of better water because they regularly consumed contaminated 
               Yellow River water. This trip taught me so much about leadership 
               and it opened my eyes to the parts of the world that are 
               less fortunate. </p>
               <p>After sharing how my engineering passion         <!--last paragraph-->
               stemmed, my future ambitions, extracurricular activities, 
               and my skills, I would like to thank you for taking the time 
               to learn all about me. If you have any questions or would 
               like to contact me, you can send me an email at: mefannin@gmail.com . 
               If you would like to find my other forms of contact, review 
               my "Contact Me" section on this website. Lastly, I invite 
               you to tour the rest of my website to learn about my journey 
               as an engineer. </p>
