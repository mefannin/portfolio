                       <p class="d-flex flex-wrap">Hello! My name is Megan Fannin and I am 
                       currently a junior in high school. As long as I can remember, 
                       I have always been fascinated with the idea of structures.
                       Everytime I walk inside one, I notice its architectural
                       features, the reinforcements, and its minuet details. 
                       Through my observations, I have discovered my love for
                       engineering, which has driven me to take multiple engineering 
                       courses offered at my school. I hope that the skills I have 
                       learned from these classes can lead me to a graduate program 
                       in Civil Engineering and eventually a hands-on job in that 
                       field.</p>
                       <p class="d-flex flex-wrap">Balancing work, ice skating, piano, debate, 
                       and school takes a lot of discipline and responsibility. 
                       Through each of these activities I have participated in, 
                       I have evolved learned character traits that will assist 
                       me when I move into the work force. My main areas of work 
                       experience have been being a camp counselor and babysitter. 
                       As a babysitter, I constantly have to balance being a playmate
                       and rule enforcer. If a child does not listen I have to 
                       enforce rules in a new way for them to understand. This has 
                       shaped me to become resourceful, pushing me to think quickly 
                       and creatively to present an idea or activity in a more 
                       engaging way. I am additionally the Treasurer of the Speech 
                       and Debate club. This position has taught me to be cooperative, 
                       responsible, and thorough. In debate, you must prepare for 
                       the topic you will be presenting at least one month in advance. 
                       There is a lot of work and time that goes into preparing 
                       because you must have deep insight into the topic and be 
                       able to supply numerous sources to back up your point. 
                       During this process, I also have a debate partner who I must 
                       cooperate with in order to be successful. Lastly, I must be 
                       thorough in order to prove my point and win the debate. 
                       All the traits of resourcefulness, cooperativeness, responsibility, 
                       and thoroughness are valuable in civil engineering. 
                       It is important to cooperate with others because  I will 
                       be working in a team of engineers. Also to create new and 
                       efficient technology, I need to be resourceful because there 
                       will always be constraints I will have to work around.</p>
                       <p class="d-flex flex-wrap">Through all the extracurriculars I have 
                       completed, there are some accomplishments that I am very proud of. 
                       I am a part of a synchronized ice skating team, and we have 
                       traveled to many nation-wide competitions. In particular, 
                       my team has won first place awards on a national level at
                       the ISI World Championship for the past 4 years. Another 
                       accomplishment of mine is participating in the COSMOS summer 
                       program at UCSD. This is a 4 week summer camp where only 
                       150-200 students are accepted, and I got the opportunity 
                       to work with college professors and research analysts in  
                       the field of Structural and Geotechnical Engineering. I 
                       was able to learn so much about the topics that Structural 
                       Engineers  encounter in their everyday lives. I was also 
                       able to create my own research project, in which I studied 
                       and built base isolation systems. Additionally, this past 
                       summer I traveled to Ningxia, China  for 2 weeks to volunteer 
                       in a local village. A group of 5 students and brought and 
                       tested  different water filtration systems that we could 
                       distribute to the villagers. These villagers were in desperate 
                       need of better water because they regularly consumed contaminated 
                       Yellow River water. This trip taught me so much about leadership 
                       and it opened my eyes to the parts of the world that are 
                       less fortunate. </p>
                       <p class="d-flex flex-wrap">After sharing how my engineering passion 
                       stemmed, my future ambitions, extracurricular activities, 
                       and my skills, I would like to thank you for taking the time 
                       to learn all about me. If you have any questions or would 
                       like to contact me, you can send me an email at: mefannin@gmail.com .
